Instead, we're interested in training a model that generates predictions that best fit our target population. Therefore, when we are doing any kind of validation, including cross-validation, it is important for us to choose the metric by which we will evaluate the performance of our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, we will predict the locations of requests for rodent inspection and abatement in the District of Columbia. When we select a validation metric, it's important for us to think about what we want to optimize. For example, do we want to make sure that our top predictions accurately identify places with rodent infestations, so we don't send our inspectors on a wild goose chase? Then we may to look at the models precision, or what proportion of its positive predictions turn out to be positive. Or do we want to make sure we don't miss any infestations? If so, we may want to look at recall, or the proportion of positive cases that are correctly categorized by the model. If we care a lot about how the model ranks our observations, then we may want to look at the area under the ROC curve, or ROC-AUC, while if we care more about how well the model fits the data, or its \"calibration,\" we may want to look at Brier score or logarithmic loss (log-loss).\n",

Independence can also have other implications for how we slice the data, which we will discuss as we progress through this lesson.\n",
